- Hi, I’m @Rajveersingh-afk (not really away from keyboard). I'm a BCIS student at The University of the Fraser Valley. I am focusing on building as many quality projects as I can   so that i get good experience and finesse the technical skills that are required and respected in the community. 
- 
- I’m interested in web development; both back-end and front-end currently. I am learning more about data analatics and algorithms along with scopes of machine learning on the       side.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more web dev projects to get more exposure to the community and also get hands-on experience about web development.
