- Hi, I’m @Rajveersingh-afk (not really away from keyboard). I'm a BCIS student at The University of the Fraser Valley. I am focusing on building as many quality projects as I can so that i get good experience and finesse the technical skills that are required and respected in the community. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web development; both back-end and front-end. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about back-end developmet with php and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more web dev projects to get more exposure to the community and also get hands-on experience about web development.
