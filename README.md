- Hi, Iâ€™m @Rajveersingh-afk (not really away from keyboard). I'm doing Bachelors in Computer Information Systems at The University of Fraser Valley. I develop websites and mobile applications.

- Iâ€™m interested in full stack development and I'm learning about data analatics and algorithms as well, along with other aspects of data science.

- My current focus is getting more involved in the community and help in open-source projects and maybe team up for a collaborative project.
