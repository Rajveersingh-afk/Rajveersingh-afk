- Hi, I’m @Rajveersingh-afk (not really away from keyboard). I'm a BCIS student at The University of the Fraser Valley. I am focusing on building as many quality projects as I can   so that I get good experience and finesse the technical skills that are required and respected in the development community. 

- I’m interested in web development; both back-end and front-end currently. I am learning about data analatics and algorithms as well along with scopes of machine learning on the   side.

- I’m looking to collaborate on more web dev projects to get more exposure to the community and also get hands-on experience about web development.
